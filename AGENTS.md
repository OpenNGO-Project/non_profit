# AGENTS.md - non_profit

`non_profit` is the shared fundraising and membership substrate. Read the bench-root `AGENTS.md` first.

## Rules

- Keep generic Member, Membership, Donor, Donation, Receipt, Campaign, Sponsor, Volunteer, and Grant behavior here.
- Do not put client-specific UI, seeding, or branding in this app. Use `ilanga_app`, `good_npo`, or a client app for that.
- Miki depends on the membership substrate. If you change Member/Membership semantics, update `miki_app` in the same change.
- This app targets the Goodvantage bench and may depend on the ecosystem where
  it helps (ERPNext is a required app, so its `Task` doctype is always present;
  `good_connector` and friends are available). Do NOT bend the design to stay
  "standalone outside Goodvantage benches" — that constraint no longer applies.
  Defensive/optional imports (e.g. `good_connector.identity_matching` for legacy
  Member registration) are still fine as good practice, not as a hard mandate.
- Keep `HOW_TO.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md` current when hooks, doctypes, public helpers, setup, scheduled jobs, or operational behavior change.
- All custom DocTypes must have Python controllers.
- All new `@frappe.whitelist()` functions need type hints.
- Desk form and list operations must use Frappe's Actions menu APIs
  (`frm.page.add_action_item`, `listview.page.add_action_item`, or
  `listview.page.add_actions_menu_item`) instead of visible inner-toolbar
  custom buttons, so Non Profit / GoodNPO views remain usable on mobile.
